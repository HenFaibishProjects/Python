# Range returns list

# Print until 10 (start by default with 0):
print range(10)

# Print from 3 until 10:
print range(3,10)

# Print from 1 until 10 with 2 jumps:
print range(1,10,2)


# XRANGE - Working the same but returns numbers without list

# Print until 10 (start by default with 0):
print xrange(10)

# Print from 3 until 10:
print xrange(3,10,1)

# Print from 1 until 10 with 2 jumps:
print xrange(1,10,2)
